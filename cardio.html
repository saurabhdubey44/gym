                        <h2>Cardio</h2>
                        <p>
                         The word 'cardio' is probably one of the first words you hear when you embark on an exercise program.  As in, you have to do a whole bunch of it.  And that's kind of true.  If you want to lose weight, you may have to do up to 300 minutes of cardio a week and that doesn't even include strength training.<br><br>So, you know you need cardio, but the real question is why you need cardio?  Getting a deeper understanding of cardio exercise may be what you need to get motivated to do it a little more often.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Why Cardio is good for you?</h3>
                        <p>
                        Before we talk about how much cardio you should do, you should at least know what it is and why it's so good for you.<br><br>For the record, cardio exercise simply means that you're doing a rhythmic activity that raises your heart rate into your Target Heart Rate Zone, the zone where you'll burn fat and calories.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Benefits of Cardio</h3>
                        <ul><li>It helps you burn fat and calories for weight loss</li>
                        <li>It makes your heart strong so that it doesn't have to work as hard to pump blood</li>
                        <li>It helps reduce risk of heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes</li>
                        <li>It increases your lung capacity</li>
                        <li>It reduces stress.</li>
                        </ul>
                            <p>I could go on and usually I do, but I think you get the point.  Even just a few minutes of cardio can have health benefits - I'm not kidding!  A 5 minute walk outside can boost your mood and help lower blood pressure, so even a little goes a long way.<br><br>You know you need cardio, so let's get to the nitty gritty with our next section, which is all about how you choose your cardio exercise.<br><br>
                            Your first step is to what kind of activities you'd like to do. The trick is to think about what's accessible to you, what fits your personality and what you'd feel comfortable fitting into your life. If you like to go outdoors, running, cycling, or walking are all good choices.</p>
                        <h3>For Home Excercisers</h3>
                        <p>
                         If you prefer going to the gym, you have access to many more options in the form of machines like  stationary bikes, elliptical trainers, treadmills, rowing machines, stairmasters and more.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Getting Started.</h3>
                        <p>
                            You have so many choices but, the trouble is, you may not even know what you like yet.  You may have to try several different activities before you find one that works for you.  This is the experiment we all have to take part in and it can be hit or miss so don't be afraid to try something and, if it doesn't work, move on to something else. Just about any activity will work, as long as it involves a movement that gets your heart rate into your Target Heart Rate Zone.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Some Important Tips for Choosing Your Cardio</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                There is no 'best' cardio exercise. Just because your friend says running is the BEST doesn't mean you have to do it, especially if running makes you feel like your entire body is falling apart.  Anything that gets your heart rate up fits the bill</li>
                        <li>
                            It's not what you do, but how hard you work. Any exercise can be challenging if you make it that way
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do something you enjoy or at least something you can tolerate. If you hate gym workouts, don't force yourself onto a treadmill. If you like socializing, consider sports, group fitness, working out with a friend or a walking club.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Choose something you can see yourself doing at least 3 days a week.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Be flexible and don't be afraid to branch out once you get comfortable with exercise
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After you choose what to do, the most important element of your workout will now be how long you do it. You should work on duration before you work on anything else--it takes time to build up the endurance for continuous exercise.<br><br>You know you probably need anywhere from 20-60 minutes of cardio to lose weight and get fit, depending on the types of workouts you do, but you don't want to start with an hour of exercise - That's just too much for anyone if you haven't exercised for awhile...or ever.</p>
                        <h3>How to Start as a Beginner</h3>
                        <p>
                            Start with an accessible exercise, like walking or a treadmill, and start with about 10-20 minutes of brisk walking at a moderate intensity.  That means you're just out of your comfort zone, at around a Level 5 or 6 on this Perceived Exertion Scale.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Beginner Workout Options</h4>
                        <ul><li>20-Minute Cardio for Absolute Beginners</li>
                        <li>25-Minute Cardio for Absolute Beginners</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Important Tips for How Long You Should Workout</h2>
                        <ul><li>You don't have to do it all at once.  You can absolutely split your workouts into smaller workouts throughout the day.  Try three 10-minute walks as a good start.</li>
                        <li>Add small bursts of cardio throughout the day by climbing stairs or speed walking.</li>
                        <li>Do all those things you know you should be doing: take the stairs, walk more, stop driving around looking for that front row parking space, etc.</li>
                        <li>Make the time. People who workout don't have more time than people who don't. They've just practiced making exercise a priority. Scheduling your workouts and treating them like any other appointment you wouldn't miss may help you stick to your program.</li>
                        <li>Pay someone to make you exercise. Finding a good personal trainer can make a difference when it comes to motivation and reaching your goals.</li>
                        <li>Do something...anything. If you think 5 minutes isn't enough time to workout, you couldn't be more wrong. Whether it's 5 minutes, 10 minutes or 60 minutes, every single minute counts.</li>
                        <li>Consider your intensity.  The harder you work, the shorter your workouts should be.  So, if you're doing Tabata Training or some other kind of High Intensity Interval Training, your workout may only be 10-20 minutes long.  If you're doing a slower, steady state workout, you can workout longer, maybe 30-60 minutes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>But, for weight loss, it's a whole other story<br><br>And it's just just about frequency - It's about intensity as well.  If you only do moderate workouts, you can probably workout every day.  But, if you do high intensity interval training, you may need more rest days thrown in there.  And, honestly, it's better to have a mixture of the two so that you're working different energy systems and giving your body something different to do so you don't burn out.</p>
