                        <h2>What is a muscle ?</h2>

                      <p>Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and motion. They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture, locomotion, as well as movement of internal organs, such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis.</p>
                      <h3>Types of Muscle Tissue</h3>  
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Skeletal muscle or "voluntary muscle"</strong>
                            <p>is anchored by tendons (or by aponeuroses at a few places) to bone and is used to effect skeletal movement such as locomotion and in maintaining posture. Though this postural control is generally maintained as an unconscious reflex, the muscles responsible react to conscious control like non-postural muscles. An average adult male is made up of 42% of skeletal muscle and an average adult female is made up of 36% (as a percentage of body mass).
                            </p>
                          </li>
                        <li><strong>Cardiac muscle (myocardium)</strong>
                            <p>, is also an "involuntary muscle" but is more akin in structure to skeletal muscle, and is found only in the heart.
                            </p>
                          </li>
                        <li><strong>Smooth muscle or "involuntary muscle"</strong>
                            <p>is found within the walls of organs and structures such as the esophagus, stomach, intestines, bronchi, uterus, urethra, bladder, blood vessels, and the arrector pili in the skin (in which it controls erection of body hair). Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle is not under conscious control.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <p>However our concern will be on Skeletal Muscles.</p>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Skeletal muscle is composed of thread-like myofibrils and sarcomeres that form a muscle fiber and are the basic units of contraction.
                            </p>
                                                        
                        </li>
                            <li>
                            <p>
                              The 650 skeletal muscles in the human body contract when they receive signals from motor neurons, which are triggered from a part of the cell called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Motor neurons tell your muscles to contract and the better you become at having those signals tell your muscles to contract, the stronger you can get.
                            </p>
                          </li>
                        <li><p>
                            After you workout, your body repairs or replaces damaged muscle fibers through a cellular process where it fuses muscle fibers together to form new muscle protein strands or myofibrils. These repaired myofibrils increase in thickness and number to create muscle hypertrophy (growth).1 Muscle growth occurs whenever the rate of muscle protein synthesis is greater than the rate of muscle protein breakdown, it occurs while you rest.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            This is where Satellite cells come in and act like stem cells for your muscles. When activated, they help to add more nuclie to the muscle cells and therefore contribute directly to the growth of myofibrils (muscle cells). Activating these satellite cells may be the difference between those who grow “massive muscles” and those who are “hard-gainers”
                          </p>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <h2>Muscle Strength</h2>
                      <p>A display of "strength" (e.g. lifting a weight) is a result of three factors that overlap:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Physiological strength (muscle size, cross sectional area, available crossbridging, responses to training).</li>
                        <li>Neurological strength (how strong or weak is the signal that tells the muscle to contract).
</li>
                        <li>Mechanical strength (muscle's force angle on the lever, moment arm length, joint capabilities).</li>
                      </ol>
                      <h2>
                          Muscle hypertrophy or Muscle grow
                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        It involves an increase in size of skeletal muscle through a growth in size of its component cells. Two factors contribute to hypertrophy: sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, which focuses more on increased muscle glycogen storage; and myofibrillar hypertrophy, which focuses more on increased myofibril size.
                      </p>
                      <h2>Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy</h2>
                      <p>
                          Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is an increase in muscle cell fluid within the sarcoplasm. Imagine grabbing a handfull of licorice vines. Each licorice vine represents a bundle of muscle fibers. Between the bundles is a fluid-filled space called the sarcoplasm. During sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, the sarcoplasmic fluid volume increases, but the muscle fiber mass does not, essentially creating larger, less dense muscles. No actual muscle growth occurs and no strength is really gained, but the muscle itself appears much larger.<br><br>
                          Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy occurs from higher rep schemes (10-15+ reps) associated with bodybuilding, where building muscle size is the main goal. It is why some people in the gym appear large and muscular but are relatively weak.<br><br>For most athletes, training for sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is not beneficial. Only high-impact sport athletes like football and rugby players should add this type of training to their programs—to gain the additional benefit of size to help reduce injuries due to impact. Most other athlete programs should focus on myofibrillar hypertrophy.
                     </p>
                     <h2>Myofibrillar Hypertrophy</h2>
                        <p>Myofibrillar hypertrophy is essentially muscle fiber growth. A myofibril is the contractile portion of a muscle fiber. Without myofibrils, our muscles could not move. When myofibrillar hypertrophy takes place, the number of myofibrils in a muscle increases, which in turn increases the muscle fiber density and strength.<br><br>Again using the example of licorice vines, if you have five vines in your hand, each one representing a myofibril within a muscle fiber, you have five contractile units within that muscle fiber. Now add three more pieces of licorice, or three more myofibrils. This represents myofibrillar hypertrophy. The muscle fiber itself has grown by adding more contractile units, making it bigger and stronger.<br><br>Myofibrillar hypertrophy occurs from heavier loads and lower rep schemes (3-5 reps). Because it involves the addition of more contractile units to the muscle cells, myofibrillar hypertrophy is more beneficial to most athletes than sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. More myofibrils means greater strength and power production.
                        </p>
                      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            If you want to build size, focus on sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and perform higher rep schemes. If strength and power are your goals, aim for myofibrillar hypertrophy with heavy weight and low rep schemes.
                        </p>

                      <h2># Mechanisms to grow Muscle</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Muscle Tension</strong>
                            You have to apply a load of stress greater than what your body or muscles had previously adapted too.You have to lift progressively heavier weights. It changes the chemistry of the muscle, allowing for growth factors that include motor neurons and satellite cell activation
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Muscle Damage</strong>
                                After working out there is a local muscle damage that causes a release of inflammatory molecules and immune system cells that activate satellite cells to jump into action.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <h3>NOTE : How to know whether “Am I Sore or Injured? ”</h3>
                            <p>Post-workout soreness can start anywhere from later that day until a few days after the workout, depending on the intensity of the workout, with a peak usually around the 36-hour mark.  However, after a couple of days, the soreness should reduce dramatically.<br><br>To help alleviate soreness and lessen the aftereffects of a hard workout, stay active and perform some light stretching or foam rolling during the 24-hours following your gym session. This movement will help to circulate blood and nutrients to the damaged tissue.<br><br>When pain persists for a longer period of time or causes an extreme restriction in movement, you may have crossed the fine line from soreness into injury. It’s likely time for a quick check-up with a medical professional.
                            </p>
                            <li><strong>Metabolic Stress</strong>
                                <p>Metabolic stress causes cell swelling or “pump” around the muscle, which helps to contribute to muscle growth without necessarily increasing the size of the muscle cells.This type of growth is known as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and is one of the ways that people can get the appearance of larger muscles without increases in strength.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Hormones</strong><p>Insulin Growth Factor (IGF)-1, in particular Mecho-Growth Factor (MGF) and Testosterone are the two most vital mechanisms that promote muscle growth.<br>Testosterone increases protein synthesis, inhibits protein breakdown, activates satellite cells, and stimulates other anabolic hormones.<br>The IGF regulates the amount of muscle mass growth by enhancing protein synthesis, facilitating glucose uptake, repartitioning the uptake of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) into skeletal muscles and once again, activates satellite cells to increase muscle growth.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Nutrition and Rest !</strong><p>
                                Provide your body with adequate rest or nutrition. The response of muscle protein metabolism to a resistance exercise bout lasts for 24-48 hours; thus, the interaction between protein metabolism and any meals consumed in this period will determine the impact of the diet on muscle hypertrophy.What you use to fuel your body is just as important as how hard you push yourself during training. Remember to have healthy, whole foods on hand but eat what you need to get through your workouts effectively.
