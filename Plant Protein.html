                        <h2>Protein in Vegetarian and Vegan Diets</h2>
                        <p>
                            Protein is a nutrient made of amino acids the building blocks for many of your body’s structures, including muscle, bone, skin, and hair. They also play a role in the creation of many substances that your body requires to go about its everyday business of living.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Plant Proteins</h3>
                        <p>
                            Most plant foods, with the
                            exception of soy, quinoa,
                            and spinach, may be low in
                            one or two of the essential
                            amino acids, but you can get
                            enough of all these amino
                            acids by including a variety of
                            whole plant foods in your diet. It was once thought that
                            plant proteins needed to be combined within a meal
                            by mixing grains and legumes to create a “complete”
                            protein, also called complementary proteins, with good
                            amounts of all essential amino acids. Now we know that
                            the liver can store the amino acids so we don’t have to
                            combine them in one meal.<br><br>
                            Legumes, which include beans, lentils, and dried peas,
                            and soy, nuts and seeds, are rich sources of protein,
                            but whole grains and vegetables contain protein, too.
                            <br><br>
                            Some whole grains, such as wheat varieties like farro,
                            Kamut®, and wheat berries provide up to 11 grams
                            of protein per cup. Even vegetables can provide
                            protein, such as spinach (5 grams per cup) and peas
                            (8 grams per cup).
                            A variety of easy-to-use meat alternatives can be
                            found in most supermarkets, such as veggie burgers,
                            meatless bacon, hot dogs, and ‘beef’ crumbles, as
                            well as faux chicken nuggets, sausage, and ‘beef’
                            strips. While these are simple solutions to meal
                            planning, you’re better off choosing minimally
                            processed plant foods that have lower levels of
                            sodium and no artificial additives.
                            Many plant proteins, including beans, lentils, and
                            soy, are naturally packed with other beneficial
                            nutrients like fiber, vitamins, minerals, healthy fat,
                            and antioxidants, and contain very little saturated
                            fat, sodium and cholesterol. This may be one reason
                            why vegetarian and vegan diets are linked with
                            lower disease risk.

                        <h3>Lacto-Ovo Vegetarians Proteins</h3>
                        <p>
                            Animal protein, such as that found in meat, dairy
                            and eggs, is considered “high quality” protein
                            because it has good amounts of all essential amino
                            acids. Meeting your protein needs may be more
                            easily accessed on a vegetarian (versus vegan) diet,
                            because you can include high quality animal protein
                            sources such as milk, cheese, cottage cheese, and
                            eggs to help meet protein needs. Some vegetarians
                            choose to use these animal proteins, however, it’s
                            important to choose reduced-fat dairy products and
                            eat dairy and eggs in moderation to avoid excess
                            intake of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How much Proteins do we need?</h3>
                        <p>The overall daily protein recommendation for
                            vegetarians is the same as for every healthy person:
                            0.4 grams per pound of body weight. For example,
                            if you weigh 150 pounds, you would multiply 150 x
                            0.4 = 60 grams of protein for your daily need. Vegans
                            and older adults may benefit from a slightly higher
                            amount of protein—approximately 0.5 grams per
                            pound of body weight.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
                        <p>
                            While many people think protein can be a challenge
                            for vegetarians and vegans, it’s easier than you think
                            to meet your needs. Focus on choices that include
                            plenty of whole, minimally processed plant foods
                            (see Protein-rich Plant Foods) at each meal and
                            snack, and avoid filling up on highly processed, low-
                            nutrient foods, such as chips, cookies and sweets,
                            and refined grain crackers, which can crowd out
                            protein in your diet.
                        </p>
